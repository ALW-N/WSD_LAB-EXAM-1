        <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is artificial intelligence?</h1>

        <p>Artificial intelligence is a constellation of many different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Maybe that’s why it seems as though everyone’s definition of artificial intelligence is different: AI isn’t just one thing.

            Technologies like machine learning and natural language processing are all part of the AI landscape. Each one is evolving along its own path and, when applied in combination with data, analytics and automation, can help businesses achieve their goals, be it improving customer service or optimizing the supply chain.
            
            Narrow (or “weak”) AI
            Some go even further to define artificial intelligence as “narrow” and “general” AI. Most of what we experience in our day-to-day lives is narrow AI, which performs a single task or a set of closely related tasks. Examples include:
            
            Weather apps
            Digital assistants
            Software that analyzes data to optimize a given business function
            These systems are powerful, but the playing field is narrow: They tend to be focused on driving efficiencies. But, with the right application, narrow AI has immense transformational power—and it continues to influence how we work and live on a global scale.
            
            General (or “strong”) AI
            General AI is more like what you see in sci-fi films, where sentient machines emulate human intelligence, thinking strategically, abstractly and creatively, with the ability to handle a range of complex tasks. While machines can perform some tasks better than humans (e.g. data processing), this fully realized vision of general AI does not yet exist outside the silver screen.
             That’s why human-machine collaboration is crucial—in today’s world, artificial intelligence remains an extension of human capabilities, not a replacement.</p>
        
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Scope</h1>
             <p>While the definitions for AI discussed above provide a general outline of the meaning of the term, there is no single universally agreed upon definition of AI. In practice, AI is used as an umbrella term that encompasses a broad spectrum of different technologies and applications, some of which are described below.

            Machine Learning (ML): Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses algorithms to process large amounts of data and learn from it. Unlike traditional rules-based programming, ML models10 learn from input data to make predictions or identify meaningful patterns without being explicitly programmed to do so. There are different types of ML models, depending on their intended function and structure:
            Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised ML, the model is trained with labeled input data that correlates to a specified output. For example, a dataset of animal photos (input data) can be labeled as “cats” or “not cats” (output data). The model is continuously refined to provide more accurate output as additional training data becomes available. After the model has learned from the patterns in the training data, it can then analyze additional data to produce the desired output. Results of supervised ML models are typically reviewed by humans for accuracy and fed back into the model for further refinement. Supervised ML is successful when the model can consistently produce accurate predictions when provided with new datasets. For example, the ML model learns to recognize if a new picture is a cat or not.
            Unsupervised Machine Learning: In unsupervised ML, the input data is not labeled nor is the output specified. Instead, the models are fed large amounts of raw data and the algorithms are designed to identify any underlying meaningful patterns. The algorithms may cluster similar data but do so without any preconceived notion of the output. For example, a time series of trade events can be inputted into an unsupervised model, with the model identifying groups of similar trades as well as outliers. Results of unsupervised machine learning models are then interpreted by humans to determine if they are meaningful and relevant.
            Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, the model learns dynamically to achieve the desired output through trial and error. If the model algorithm performs correctly and achieves the intended output, it is rewarded. Conversely, if it does not produce the desired output, it is penalized. Accordingly, the model learns over time to perform in a way that maximizes the net reward. For example, in the securities industry, reinforcement learning models are being explored for options pricing and hedging.11
            Deep Learning: A deep learning model is built on an artificial neural network, in which algorithms process large amounts of unlabeled or unstructured data through multiple layers of learning in a manner inspired by how neural networks function in the brain. These models are typically used when the underlying data is significantly large in volume, obtained from disparate sources, and may have different formats (e.g., text, voice, and video). For example, some firms in the securities industry are developing surveillance and conduct monitoring tools built on deep learning models. Deep learning applications can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement based.
            Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP is a form of AI that enables machines to read or recognize text and voice, extract value from it, and potentially convert information into a desired output format, such as text or voice. Examples of NLP applications in the securities industry range from keyword extraction from legal documents and language translation to more complex tasks, such as sentiment analysis and providing relevant information through chat-boxes and virtual assistants.
            Computer Vision (CV): CV (also referred to as machine vision) is a “field of computer science that works on enabling computers to see, identify and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide appropriate output.”12 Frequently a CV application will use ML models to interpret what it “sees” and make predictions or determinations. Examples of CV-based applications include facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, optical character recognition, and other biometric tools to verify user identity.
            Robotics Process Automation (RPA): RPA refers to the use of preprogrammed software tools that interact with other applications to automate labor-intensive tasks, resulting in increased accuracy, speed, and cost-savings. RPA tools are generally used for high-volume, repetitive processes involving structured data, such as account reconciliation, accounts payable processing, and depositing of checks. Some market participants do not consider RPA to be a form of AI because its focus is on automation of processes in a manner more akin to a rules-based system.13 However, others consider it to be a rudimentary form of AI, particularly when it is combined with other technologies such as ML.
